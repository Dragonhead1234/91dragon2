The game currently has six game modes: 
Hill Control, Domination, Team Deathmatch (TDM), Free For All (FFA), Artifact (Arti), Gun game, and Capture the Flag (CTF). 
A match in Energy Assault lasts for 10 minutes (it used to be 15 minutes during early versions) and the team with the highest score wins. 
Game time can also be changed on private servers with the Private Server Controls gamepass (you can only change the settings on your own private server), 
which costs 899 Robux.
