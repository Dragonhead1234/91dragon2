DOORS is a first-person horror experience created by Lightning_Splash and RediblesQW with additional help by GhostlyWowzers.
The game was published under the group LSPLASH.
DOORS is currently on Floor 1 (Hotel),
but some sneak peeks involving Floor 2 have been found.
DOORS is a first-person horror game with the end objective of reaching Door 100 while avoiding entities that try to kill players.
 Within the lobby,

players can enter elevators that can consist of up from 1 to 4 players to explore The Hotel.
(Up to 12 in private servers.) Players start in the elevator and are given a pre-run shop to purchase 4 available items: Vitamins, 
Lockpicks, 
Lighter, 
and Flashlight.
Once players exit the elevator,
players will enter the Reception Room and must receive the key from the billboard to unlock the door.
The rest of the game is progressing by entering the following doors to enter the next room. Almost every following room is randomly generated,
with a set of predetermined rooms that appear in a different order in every game that is played. 
Rooms will comprise interactable furniture like shelves that contain coins,
items, 
key, 
or just nothing, 
and wardrobe/beds that allows players to hide in from Rush and Ambush.
Some rooms will be dark—either naturally or by Ambush or Rush—and locked doors that require a hidden key to unlock.
